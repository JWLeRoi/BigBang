:fireworks::boom: The Big Bang-Shang-A-Lang Fireworks Company :boom::fireworks:

This is a CRUD application written for WebLab Spring 2015. It is a single page application using Embedded Javascript and AJAX/JSON to swap content in and out of the index page. It allows the user to manage the inventory of a fireworks company and to find the location of stores that have the fireworks in stock. It was originally created in the gh-pages branch to make it a live site but GitHub won't serve out PHP pages, so it was transferred to a master branch. The comments are quite sparse and the dead code needs to be cleaned out. It's on my todo list.
