:boom:The Big Bang-Shang-A-Lang Fireworks Company:boom:

This is a CRUD application written for WebLab Spring 2015. It is a single page application using Embedded Javascript and AJAX/JSON to swap content in and out of the index page. It allows the user to manage the inventory of a fireworks company and to find the location of stores that have the fireworks in stock. It was originally created in the gh-pages branch to make it a live site but GitHub won't serve out PHP pages, so it was transferred to a master branch.
